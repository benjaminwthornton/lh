      <h1 class="title">What is LyteHacks?</h1>
      <p>
        LyteHacks is a product of TechNole, a Recognized Student Organization at Florida State University.
        Our focus is to connect local businesses with TechNole members in a hackathon-type environment in order to provide solutions to benefit the business.
        These “mini-hackathons” will be done throughout the year and incorporate tasks for the TechNole members to complete in 10-hours or less.
        TechNole members will benefit from these events by learning new skills and will also be given rewards for their work.
        These factors combined result in timely, thought out, and focused solutions to fit the needs of the partnered business.
      </p>
      <h1 class="title">Our Mission</h1>
      <p>
        The Mission of Lytehacks is to provide a meaningful partnership between young, talented developers and local Tallahassee companies.
        Through giving opportunity and incentive to the developers, there will be a great return in the types of solutions and products that will be created during a LyteHacks event for businesses.
        Partnering local businesses with LyteHacks developers allows for students to give back to the community while also putting their experience to work and gaining new knowledge.
      </p>
      <h1 class="title">What is a Hackathon?</h1>
      <p>
        An event that brings in software and hardware engineers, designers, and other inspired students to create team projects, or hacks, from scratch.
        The projects created through this type of collaboration are truly inspiring and some go on to be very successful.
        Student hackathons have exploded throughout the US and a Hacker Culture has formed.
        The sense of community is unrivaled from any other kind of event in the nation and it has been formed from the common goal to hack.
        To be a hacker comes with an attitude of building to learn, working together, and the desire to create.
        To see how inspiring this community really is <a href="https://medium.com/search?q=hackathons" target="_blank">look at some blog posts</a>, written by the community.
